Question2 - Document how to run the program you created in question 1 in a readme.md file in your repo. Be as clear as possible. Use proper markdown, and consider using screenshots. Be sure to briefly discuss why this kind of exercise might be helpful for NLP in your markdown.
Created two different codes and saved in cat_file_question_1.py. Second one is in cat_question_1_reducer.py + cats_mapper.py
For cat_file_question_1.py, saved the code in VSCode and needs to be executed in terminal. 
This can be done by giving the path to the directory and then pass in "python cat_file_question_1.py" (python space and then the file name). It produces the output with frequency count
For the second type where i used both mapper and reducer, i need to pass in python mapperfilename.py | python reducerfilename.py

# Readme helps other coders to get a clear understanding of the requirements and the code without digging deep into the code. 
# comments in the code also does this but needs to go through each line and check the code, whereas readme is like one stop notes for the code taht is inside.
